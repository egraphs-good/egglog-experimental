; A datatype for representing polynomials in a single variable over R.
; Polynomials have two representations:
; - lists of monomials
; - lists of factors raised to a power, along with a real coefficient.
; Polynomial representations should not be mixed in inputs or rules,
; but must be the same datatype to be equated in the egraph.
(datatype Monomial
  (Term f64 i64)) ; (Term a b) = ax^b
(datatype Factor
  (Fact f64 i64)) ; (Fact a b) = (x-a)^b
(datatype Polynomial
  ; sum of monomials representation
  (Zero) ; (Zero) := 0
  (Add Monomial Polynomial) ; (Add m p) := m + p

  ; product of factors representation
  (Coef f64) ; (Coef a) := a
  (Mul)

  ; backend values and tags
  (Smt SMTReal) ; backend value used for factoring
  (Factorable Polynomial)) ; tag to indicate we should factor this polynomial
